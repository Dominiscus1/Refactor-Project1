Code-Refactor

Overview:

The project is to refactor HTML for HTML5 semantic elements. It allows for easier readability 
and offers the same functionality as older versions of html that us tags such as <div> and <span>.
Those elements are not as easy to read since tags such as <div> and <span>
offer no real meaning compared to a <header> which tell the reader that it contains header elements.
The project was carried out using HTML5, CSS, and VScode as our IDE. I used Github for my local repository
and git to add,commit, and push changes to the public repository.
